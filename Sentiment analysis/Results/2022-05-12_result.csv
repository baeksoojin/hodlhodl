But the difference each time is higher highs and higher lows. Prices we once were excited about are now prices we are disappointed about. The stock market, bitcoin, shitcoins, everything is down. So you cannot single out bitcoin, it's illogical.

The longer you've been holding Bitcoin, the less these dips phase you. Especially when you have daily hashrate ATHs, more adoption/discussion than ever before, and so much more.

So please, don't let short-term negative price movements get to you. It's not always going to be up up up. There will be many of such dips in between the ATHs. The difference is: Will you make use of them? Or will you run away scared?",negative,0.34513274336283184

44,2022-05-12,"I decided to get into bitcoin during the March 2020 crash. I came to this sub for guidance, haha. I remember reading nothing but falling knife comments, one after the other. It‚Äôs easy to look back and see how obvious it was to buy in at 4K but at the time I remember being terrified to pull the trigger. I kept reading that it was going to keep dropping, don‚Äôt buy now, wait till $1000. Luckily I did buy in around the 4-5K range but nowhere near what I wish I had.
 The sentiment of this sub was what held me back from putting more in. Since then it has been a wild ride and I was nervous DCAing in at every step. I was scared to buy in the 6K range, 7,8,9, every time I got a pit in my stomach hitting the buy button. Every time I bought and it dropped I felt like a moron and a rube, but now looking back I am so happy I did. Don‚Äôt let yourself get shook out.
 If you buy here and it drops to 20k just simmer down and hodl. That‚Äôs all you have to do, one of the best quotes I've learned during my time in this space is investing is the impatient giving their money to the patient. Or something like that. That‚Äôs harder than it sounds because we are inundated with either massive FUD or over the top hopium of ‚Äúparabolic moon mission imminent!!!‚Äù Just buy in during these dips as much as you can afford without overextending yourself and wait. You won‚Äôt time the bottoms so stop trying‚Ä¶
 I held off buying around the 11k range because at that time in this space everybody was saying that you‚Äôre dumb to buy because the belief was BTC would fill the CME gap at 9.6K. So I waited‚Ä¶ and waited‚Ä¶ 12K, 12.5K, 13. Down to 11.5 again! Here comes the inevitable gap fill!! Then BLAMMO we were looking at 14, 15,000 prices! Fuck! Guess I‚Äôll buy now haha.

588,2022-05-12,"You might find this guide useful: [https://bitcoin.org/en/choose-your-wallet](https://bitcoin.org/en/choose-your-wallet)

There are plenty of options to choose from. If it's a large sum that you cannot afford to lose, the general advice here will be to purchase a hardware wallet (Coldcard, BitBox, Ledger, Trezor, etc.) A hardware wallet is a dedicated device for handling your Bitcoin.

And yeah, the private key (which is what you use to authorize transactions and soend your Bitcoin) can be encoded into a 12 or 24 word mnemonic seed phrase. So long as you have it, you can restore your funds on most software and hardware wallets even if your original wallet gets lost or destroyed. As such, keeping your seed phrase safe and secure is very important.

Although it seems daunting at first, it's not as complex as it sounds. Try it out with a small sum first to get the feel for it, and make absolutely sure you can recover your wallet before putting anything sizeable in it.

Check out r/BitcoinBeginners for more information, and congrats for considering taking things into your own custody.",positive,0.34513274336283184

As for wallet, get a Ledger or a Trezor hardware wallet. Set it up with the 12 or 24 word seed words and an additional ""25th word"" passphrase. Then transfer a tiny amount of bitcoin to it. Then completely reset the hardware wallet and do the full recovery process to confirm that you did everything right and can access that bitcoin. Then transfer your stack (you can transfer the full stack in portions if you're extra paranoid, so that a mistake doesn't jeopardize your whole stack). Then make sure to save your seed words and pass phrase securely, in separate locations. Then forget about bitcoin for a year, work on relationships, personal development, hobbies,and work.

1076,2022-05-12,"I'd have to disagree with your assessment, with the potential caveat of staked coins/tokens.  Assuming we are talking about people that simply buy crypto and keep it on the exchange or use Coinbase's wallet, those holdings would not be considered an asset.  Those would be considered a liability (similar to a deposit account of a bank).  Now if someone staked their coins and CB lent those out, it would get trickier as you would have a liability (to the staker) and an asset (from the borrower).  At the end of the day though, the Trustee can only marshal the *assets* of the estate for the benefit of creditors. 

One way to think about it is a parking garage that goes bankruptcy.  If that happens, the land, structure, bank accounts, etc. of the parking garages are subject to collection, sale, and distribution by the Trustee to the creditors.  But people's cars that are parked in the garage do not suddenly become assets of the estate that can be sold.  It gets trickier if someone loans their car to the garage who then rents it out to a third party, but even then the Trustee would be more focused on returning the car to the original creditor (who should be deemed a secured creditor, hopefully) and getting paid by the person who rented the car so that those proceeds can go to the creditors based on priority.",neutral,0.34513274336283184

If you buy bitcoin and leave it on the exchange, there's no specific bitcoin that is ""yours"" because they don't give you the private key, so it's not quite like the car parking garage example. I agree that it seems to be a similar situation to a bank (without FDIC).

In the bank scenario (assuming no FDIC), what would happen to deposits in a fractional reserve scenario where the amount of bitcoin CB held was less than the amount of bitcoin users ""owned"" in their exchange accounts? Does the amount of bitcoin CB holds get distributed ratably among all users? And then would those users have an unsecured claim for the balance?

1202,2022-05-12,"All excellent questions.  And this really is ""cutting edge"" bankruptcy stuff, much of which I don't think has a black/white answer at this time.  

So, in theory at least, coins held on an exchange are essentially being held in a custodial wallet.  You don't have they key, but you are *suppose* to be the owner of the coin/token.  Similar to a safety deposit box (best example I can think of on the fly).  In theory, without staking, Coinbase and other exchanges should not be able to loan out your crypto as you have not agreed to lend it.  Instead, it *should* be sitting safely in the ""safety deposit box"".  Now, if all hell breaks loose and Coinbase goes under and the ""safety deposit box"" has actually been ransacked and loaned out, then you the owner of the tokens have a claim.  Likely an unsecured claim, unfortunately.  Whether you could try to sneak in as a priority claim (as there are priority claims for certain deposit accounts) I think is unlikely, but you would certainly see people try it especially in more debtor friendly circuits like the 9th. 

Regarding a preference claim, I'm not convinced it would qualify as a preference as it is not a transfer of an interest of the debtor in property.  As these coins/tokens should be seen solely as liabilities of the exchange, the debtor/exchange has no interest in them as they would not be property of the estate.  Preference claims are designed to prevent a debtor from giving away its property within 90 days to 1 year (depending on the receiving party) of the filing of the bankruptcy.  They are not designed to prevent the debtor from returning other people's property to them (e.g. the parking garage example).  If it was shown to be a preference, you of course would have various defenses available (ordinary course, aggregate value depending on the amount taken off the exchange, maybe new value depending on the specific facts, etc.).

Regarding preferences, I do think the facts could change with respect to coins/tokens that are loaned out by the exchange.  Also, for any coins/tokens that are given away for free or that are given away for watching videos, etc. could be taken back.  Additionally, interest payments on staked coins/tokens could also see claw back attempts.  Keep in mind though, most trustees are not going to go after small claims.  Usually you need to have a claim of at least 10k to actually file a lawsuit (anything over $1,000 is probably getting a demand letter).  Maybe 5k if you have really aggressive Trustee counsel.  Otherwise they will just abandon the claim. 

Now the practical answer is also the Trustee can only distribute the assets that they collect.  So if your bitcoin has simply ""disappeared"" and there is nothing to collect, then yes you as an exchange holder would likely be screwed.  However, I do not see a scenario where a Trustee would use coins/tokens that were owned by customers and then liquidating them for other creditors (e.g. investors/lenders in the company).",neutral,0.34513274336283184
