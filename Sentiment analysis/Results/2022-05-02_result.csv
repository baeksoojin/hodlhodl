Wife: ""Why would they get rich?""

Me: ""Well, the idea is that its the currency of the future, and everyone will use it.""

Wife: ""then wouldn't all your money just transfer to butcoin? Why would they be rich?""

Me: ""Because there is a finite supply of bitcoin. They only made so many.""

Wife: ""that sounds dumb. Why would they do that?""

Which.. I couldn't really answer. I understand that its to avoid inflation, but that necessarily means bitcoin is a deflationary asset (finite supply with a growing population). Deflation is bad for a currency. Good for an asset.

Which leads me to ask, how many here believe bitcoin will become an actual currency around the world? Or will it just remain an asset/store of value? 

If it's meant to become a currency, I see a somewhat moral problem with hoarding it now. Doesn't that reduce the amount available for others? Like those living in poverty or without internet (who would really need it the most)? And those not yet born don't even have a chance to get in early.

Woah. Thats quite a conspiracy. 

Deflation is not good for currency. It incentivizes hoarding, not spending nor investing. What generally happens here is people start to trade alternative stand-ins for bitcoins. Especially ones that won't be worth as much later. Buyers like to buy with things/tokens/currencies that will be less valuable later, not the other way around. 

Moreover, this infinite division of bitcoin isn't a good thing. You'll see an evershrinking supply of bitcoin being shared amongst each new generation, as bitcoin is accumulated pining the earlier adopters. You're going to end up with a mega wealthy class of earlier adopters. This type of division is really great for people that already own a lot of bitcoin, but not so much for others. Knowing that there will be less bitcoin for others the share and use, **how can you morally justify buying and hoarding it now.**",negative

These seem like contradictory statements to me. My point was: there is a finite supply of bitcoin. When someone buys bitcoin, it *reduces the supply* for others. Taken to a logical extreme: if 21 million people each bought 1 bitcoin, how much would be left for everyone else?",negative
216,216,22-05-02,">It doesn't reduce the amount available to others

Yes it does. If you have 1 bitcoin, then the rest of the world permanent has one less bitcoin to share amongst themselves. This makes the bitcoin more valuable, the entire reason for buying in early.

"" It incentivizes hoarding, not spending nor investing."" 

I think good innovation, products and ideas should incentivise spending e.g. if i see a good laptop that i like I buy it regardless of the fact that it will depreciate & if i am hungry i will still buy food. I shouldnt have to invest so before my money looses   value. 

Money value should reflect the hours of work you do in your job and this value should be stored because you put in the hours. 

The current system leads to overinflatted assets e.g. look at housing. People buy houses to store their value and this leads to people that cant afford houses.

btc = the ideal asset and store of value. it is a better form of what gold should have been currently.

if people bought btc to store their value, then other assets would not be overvalued e.g. people would afford their own home to live in and investing in property for the sake of storing value is pointless

morally we are not hoarding it. because btc is divisible future generations will still benefit from it and their value will be stored. 

 If I hoard it, use it as collateral, never spend it, then die and pass it onto my kids - who then aim to accumulate more of it and never sell it and use it as collateral... then my lineage will benefit. My kids wont need to worry about money and can instead focus on creative outputs e.g. art, music, creativity, innovation.....which they can store the value of by accumulating more btc..... if they choose to get hooked on drugs  and spend all the btc away then they will destroy the value they had stored and this is essentially reflecting that their output has gone down ....  thats not my problem cause im dead lol
