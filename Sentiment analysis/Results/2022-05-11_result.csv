Lido now controls over 4M of all staked ETH (~33%), up from 2M in February and 1M in August 2021. At this rate a single organisation could easily control a majority of staked ETH by year's end.

110,2022-05-11,"I have a serious question regarding Bitcoin and Cryptocurrency. Someone please clear my doubt.

The main advantages of Bitcoin or any solid crypto currency are 1) accessibility across borders 2) Transparency and anonymity 3) Govt. can't control it's value. Because of all these and other benefits, we claim that people should migrate from govt controlled currency to Bitcoin and crypto. 

A lot of people claim that govt. not having any power on the currency as the best thing but the following logic says otherwise.

Today Bitcoin is technically superior than any fiat currency. Say, if almost all of us migrated to Bitcoin and made it the primary currency in a few years. And later a new digital currency, based on a technology much better than block chain, is invented by someone and it has all the above said benefits of Bitcoin and also has less limitations (Example: less energy consumption, faster transactions, less data to be maintained etc). Following our logic, we should all migrate to that new coin making bitcoin invalid if govt has no control over their country's currency. With time, technology develops exponentially and new, better currencies will come more frequently making the previous one useless. So all the currency you earned based on your hardwork, jobs etc becomes less valuable because a better currency is in market and you don't have it yet.

You see the problem in the above scenario right? We can't have an independent currency like that if we want stability in the society. Shouldn't we have govt. control over it. After all, Govt is the representation of their citizens. They are the people and work for the people only. Atleast in theory.

290,2022-05-11,"Government control of currency value or ability to issue or manipulate value is inherently disastrous. Let me illustrate. 

For centuries, gold was the ultimate store of value and medium of exchange. It was anonymous, had zero counter-party risk, and was resistant to manipulation. It didn’t make one ass hair of difference what clown’s face was stamped on it. Country of issuance didn’t mean shit. Gold was gold was gold no matter where it came from. It was the ultimate decentralized money. The world got along just fine. 

Now let’s talk about what happens when the government in their ultimate wisdom puts their fucktarderized hands on money. A clear early example was the Roman denarius. It started out as a mostly silver coin. Government manipulation slowly lowered the silver content until after a few hundred years the silver was effectively removed. The coins were no longer valued at home, but more importantly abroad. 

Here in the US, the paper dollar was nothing more than a debt instrument. An IOU or coupon redeemable for whatever amount of gold was printed on it. $20 bill could be brought to the bank and traded for a $20 gold piece.   

Decoupling gold from the dollar, which happened in increments over several major events during the twentieth century- creation of the fed, gold confiscation and revaluation by FDR, Bretton-Woods, and Nixon’s decoupling. ( Look them up and read at your convenience), essentially destroyed the value of the dollar, which continues to this day and is what the creators of the problem, the fed, are desperately trying to get under control- the effects of which you read about daily in the paper. 

Let’s illustrate further. Remember that fat $20 gold piece we talked about earlier? Well you’ll be relieved to know that you can still buy gold for $20. Of course you’re going to need tweezers to pick it up and make sure there isn’t a strong wind present or you might lose it. Oh, if you decided you want that $20 gold piece instead, you’ll need to fork over $2000. Yes, you read that right. 

That’s why government money is a bad idea. Just think of bitcoin as modern gold. Except it’s confiscation-proof if handled properly and can be transported safely from anywhere to anywhere. 

As a side note, I recently read about some poor guy from India who got caught trying to “smuggle” HIS OWN GOLD into of the country. Here’s how desperate he was to move it anonymously. He melted it into a dildo and had it stuffed up his ass. He lost the gold, his freedom, and his dignity. Why? Because of a country’s psychopathic need to control other people’s money. Bitcoin more than fixes this, and btw, it’s easier on your ass during international travel

If anything changes and something comes along better than bitcoin ( I don’t think that’s gonna happen but who knows) then people should also be free to migrate to the next great thing. Government is inherently corrupt. It’s only to what matter of degree that’s ever in question.",negative,0.449203187250996

Most of the society is not into financial markets. All they want is to get paid for their work which they can use to buy stuff. If bitcoin is the common currency instead of a govt backed one, the day the better currency comes, a nurse or a carpenter who got paid in bitcoin will have no longer have the money, they think they had, for buying their car. Because bitcoin has lost value with the new currency.

This day will come some decades or centuries later. But since technology develops rapidly, newer better currencies will come more regularly and your saved money of that year will lose value more frequently.

If we only had gold and no paper currency and initially i would be able to buy a bike for that gold piece. But after all those decades, i wouldn't even get the tires of that bike with the same weight of gold right. Because of inflation. Doesn't matter if I am using gold currency or paper currency.

How can we claim that we're not going to have a new bitcoin. After all, crypto currencies are technology based. And as we know, technologies develop rapidly sometimes. Block chain can't be the pinnacle. There might come a better technology right? 

Money or currency evolved like bitcoin. Group of people agreed to use the same thing for exchange of goods. More and more people joined and finally govts settled.

I know it's all ideal scenario but all I'm talking is in theory. Currency has value only if the citizens of that nation agree that it's the common currency. We people through govt have established that dollar is currency for US, Pound for UK and Rupee for India.

If we ignore this concept of currency and select a currency based only on benefits, any currency will go down when a superior technology based currency comes into place.
