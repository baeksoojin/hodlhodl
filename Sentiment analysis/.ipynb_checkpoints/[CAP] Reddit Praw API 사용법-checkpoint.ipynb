       "55  Been here since 2014 and here’s some thoughts:\\n\\nThis is painful but so far fits within the general cycle progression. There are a lot of macro events going on that are somewhat unprecedented and this is driving the markets down. The markets are further being driven down by fear of the unknown in this changing macro environment. Furthermore the markets are being driven down now by liquidations and exchanges/funds imploding and defaulting. \\n\\nThere is overwhelming negativity regarding the future prosperity in the world at the moment and this is reflected in the markets.\\n\\nConversely when the factors causing this negativity resolve I fully expect a massive and relatively swift upward correction leading into the next decades long cycle.  \\n\\nIt could get bad for a while, but if you truly are in the long game I’m as confident as ever we will see a new all time high , and very likely before 2024   \n",

       "94  Celsius liquidation price now is $18,388. Whales are hunting him down. Was at $22k but they posted more collateral to bring it down to $18,388. Watch this level. This won't end until he is liquidated. That's when i buy in. That's my plan at least. Unless there are some new positive developments. Sort of in a death spiral now with Celsius.\\n\\nDon't be scared of bear markets, that's where the money is made.\\n\\nHope non of you degens have money stuck in Celsius. I have $60 there that i forgot about. lol\\n\\n[https://defiexplore.com/cdp/25977](https://defiexplore.com/cdp/25977)\\n\\nEdit. Liquidation is now $17,211.
