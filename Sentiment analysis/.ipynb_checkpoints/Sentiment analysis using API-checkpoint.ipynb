      "\n",
      "In order to put a price on that side, you need to put a “limit buy” or a “limit sell” order into the exchange. Limit buy and limit sell is just telling coinbase that I want to buy or sell bitcoin at a certain price. \n",

      "Let’s say I put a limit buy order for 1 bitcoin @ $30,000. If someone puts a limit sell order in for 1 bitcoin @ $30,000, then coinbase will fill my order. I will now have bought 1 bitcoin and the other person sold 1 bitcoin.\n",
      "\n",
      "Remember that image of a buy and sell list. When you put a limit buy or a limit sell, it goes into those lists, also known as an order book. When you go to buy bitcoin without setting a “limit order”, all coinbase is doing is selling you the cheapest bitcoins in that list, getting you the “best deal”. \n",

      "The last buy or sell that was completed, is the price that you are seeing. It’s not a special formula.\n",
      "On an exchange, there are 3 types of prices that are important: bid, ask, and trade. Trade prices are the price point where a buyer and a seller agree to transact. In the absence of recent trades, the current price is set by the highest buyer (bid) and the lowest seller (ask). If there’s a gap (spread) between the bid and ask prices, exchanges will generally print the midpoint as the indicative current price.\n",
      "\n",
      "This is an automated process. The “market depth” or “order book” will show you the volume of buyers and sellers active around the current inside price.\n",
      "There’s nobody sitting at a desk pressing a button don’t be so ridiculous. The truth is there’s and EXTREMELY TINY person inside of your phone changing which  numbers hit the screen, and they decide the bitcoin price for you based on how their tiny arms are doing. Fr though, it’s in between the bids and asks, and some exchanges use an oracle to include data on other exchanges  in their price.\n",
      "The buyers and sellers set the price, not the exchange.\n",
      "It’s called a feedback loop. Let’s say there is a bitcoin ticker that posts the latest price of bitcoin on several (in this example, 2) local exchanges. Now imagine the following situation: say there is a seller asking for $45,000USD / BTC on Exchange #1, but has that has not found a buyer, and a seller on another exchange #2 who has been able to find a buyer at a much lower $40,000 / BTC. That sale price of $40,000 is posted and the ticker reflects this new price. So now a new buyer can see that BTC is being sold for $40,000, and depending on market sentiment, may be willing to pay more or less than $40,000. If the market sentiment is weak, then the seller on exchange #1 is incentivized to lower their $45,000 ask price to closer to $40,000, and/or buyers may be looking to spend less than $40,000, say no more than $39,750 / BTC. If the market sentiment is strong, and there’s fewer bitcoins on exchanges, the seller may not need to lower their price as much, or at all. Indeed, as FOMO sets in the seller may even be able to raise their asking price. As this simulation repeats and changes the latest sale price, the bitcoin ticker updates the information- a feedback loop is when the outcome of the previous iteration affects the next iteration feeding back information on itself so it converges on a similar state- in this case a common / similar price on both exchanges.\n",
      "As stated, arbitrage is what keeps the price relatively the same on all exchanges. Any site that doesn't have their own order book though will just aggregate the price from all the exchanges and average it.\n",

      "Thanks\n",
      "Thanks\n",
      "No, that's not how an order book works. If someone placed a market buy order for 1 million dollars on an exchange, that market buy order will eat into the order book starting at the lowest sell order. The price will rise a bit as it eats into the order book and the price of bitcoin during the last trade will be the price of bitcoin on that exchange.\n",
      "No, because the order goes to the highest buyer (\\~38k).\n",
      "good question\n",
      "I don’t think so. If you list at a price way lower than market it will get consumed instantly and someone will get a nice deal. You will actually see this on other crypto assets sometimes, it results in a massive downward wick on the candle where the person messed up.\n",
      "Proper exchanges don't work like that. If a limit order is placed with a price far away from the best orders on the book, the exchange starts by eating up the best orders, working its way down the list until the order is fulfilled (if possible). The \"luck\" in this case is for the person placing the order that's way out there.\n",
      "\n",
      "As an example: If you place a Bitcoin limit sell order for $20K while there are many buy orders at $40K, you'll end up getting your order fulfilled for around that $40K point, giving you a better outcome than the limit you set.\n",
      "\n",
      "Massive wicks that you see sometimes are either because the exchange has screwed up and hasn't handled its order processing correctly, but more often because many smaller altcoins have very thin order books and a large market sell order (or limit order with low limit) can eat through a large part of the buy side of the book.\n",

      "Ownership is usually something that is enforced - and while we normal rely on localised laws to enforce this, with BTC it is up to ourselves to enforce this ownership by keeping our seed phrase secure. The fact it is knowledge-based and not physical is what makes such decentralised standards of ownership feasible.\n",
      "and if you have money in your bank account, i can commit fraud and steal it; and if you have fiat and i mug you or break into your house, i can steal it; and if you have gold in a safe and i figure out the combination, i can also steal that. it’s all perspective, and bitcoin is incredibly hard to gain access to if it’s not yours and the owner isn’t an idiot.\n",

If you want to proof big amounts and haven't reused the same address (which is recommended) the amount to proof then should be all under in the same address. \n",
      "\n",

      "Maybe its a matter of time for you to really feel its this way is better than any custodian. First time I installed a non-custodian wallet, I also felt a bit insecure. That turns around 180° with time !\n",

The punchline is it is statistically very unlikely that someone in the past or future will be given the same private key as yours. If that happens however, the person with the same key can spend your bitcoin.\n",

      "So here's one solution: put your coins in a passphrase-protected hidden wallet that's connected to your private key. For those that use hidden wallets, spending bitcoin requires both the seed phrase and the passphrase. So, even in the unlikely event someone is given the same private key (i.e. seed phrase) as you, the sats inside your hidden wallet will remain: (1) hidden; and (2) safe because YOU picked the passphrase, not the device. That means that if the passphrase is truly unique and you are the only one that knows it, it won't matter of anyone has your same seed.\n",

Equities have been dumping since January and Bitcoin has held relatively steady. Once it's clear we are in the middle of the recession the smart money will try to front-run the recovery and pile back in to Bitcoin and other equities and it will take off from there.

For example if the fed holds firm on their interest rate increases that will have a dampening effect on everything. Higher interest rates will make bonds look more attractive, which is a big target that Bitcoin is trying to syphon capital from. The fed is in a tough spot though, because if the recession is particularly rough they will want to bring rates back down to juice the economy. However that will increase inflation which is what they are trying to combat by raising them. It's unlikely that rates will go up enough that bonds earn more than inflation any time soon though.

CashApp and Strike likely charge a fixed fee for LN transactions, or perhaps they don't pass this cost on to the user at all?, either way, if a lot of their outgoing transactions were from CashApp/Strike users, to CashApp/Strike users, they would benefit from having a direct channel with one another, as this would reduce tx fees.

If the market stays the same, well you haven't lost anything either.\n",

As people decide to regularly buy it as part of their savings plan, it has no choice but to rocket. No matter how many coins big Bitcoin whales sell, they will only be a dip, and those whales won't be able to get it back at the same price again. \n",

      "If you want a whole Bitcoin, buy one, but make sure you keep it off exchange in a secure wallet. And keep backups of everything. The price might go down more, but it's trivial, volatile and fast. You'll be more likely to miss out than to capitalise on it, as it can go up 20% in a day without batting an eyelid.

The fun thing about Bitcoin is that it doesn’t care if any individual hates it, as long as enough people do believe in it—and run nodes—nothing can stop it from existing.

When a node receives a new transaction or block, it relays it to its peers, so that all nodes and miners can remain in sync and maintain identical blockchain.\n",

The nodes ensure the block a miner added was done correctly via the bitcoin consensus rules.  They are the ones that actually add that block to their own local copy of the blockchain and then transmit their version of the blockchain out to the other nodes.  The nodes are what actually maintain the consistent blockchain.  When you look up your bitcoin balance for instance, its going to a node.  That node looks up the balance of the particular bitcoin address on its own local copy the blockchain.

Anonymous whistle blowers, martyrs for free speech, and not-so-shadowy cyber coders assemble around a grand representation of the bitcoin money system; surrounded by ranks of satoshi-based angelic figures: seraphim, cherubim, thrones, and dominions. A network of meditating node runners arise above the lake of fire, escaping the flames of the fiat money system as the bitcoin network lights up with energy from the ever-increasing hash power validating each block in the proof of work consensus.\n",

      "714 :  So profits in stock market using leveraged aka cheap money wiped out.  Bitcoin stable around 40K.  Fiat financial system is a rigged game for retail  investors.  Bitcoin is fair for all.  Dollar is strong atm but that won't last.  Old luddites like Buffet (who does not use a computer) will never get it.  Same for the oldies in our government, they have no clue either.  It's only a matter of time.  Bitcoin is better monetary technology and technology always moves forward never back.  Don't doubt me I'm in the tech business and rate of change is hard to keep up with.  You accept it and adapt or you go out of business...I've watched companies in denial try to hold on to the buggy whip and they don't make it. \n",

I don't necessarily agree with the conclusion, that it is a dead certainty that Bitcoin itself will drive out existing fiat, but that it provides governments all the more incentive to improve their own monetary systems. :) The section about other currencies historically becoming well used in places they didn't originate from is exactly the comparison I was trying to make. However, we aren't still using Greek and Roman coins today, in part because those empires no longer exist, and because other systems outclassed it in the long run. And even while they were accepted in many places, it didn't completely drive out local currency everywhere. Do I think Bitcoin has that potential? Not really. But I think it will pave the way to better monetary systems one way or the other, and people should be happy about that. For those who have made their living (and fame, in some cases) learning and capitalizing on the current system (no pun intended), of course they don't want to see the status quo upset.

Management has done very well in reinvesting earnings  which has led the company to have a $1 trillion market cap.

That sale price of $40,000 is posted and the ticker reflects this new price. So now a new buyer can see that BTC is being sold for $40,000, and depending on market sentiment, may be willing to pay more or less than $40,000. If the market sentiment is weak, then the seller on exchange #1 is incentivized to lower their $45,000 ask price to closer to $40,000, and/or buyers may be looking to spend less than $40,000, say no more than $39,750 / BTC. If the market sentiment is strong, and there’s fewer bitcoins on exchanges, the seller may not need to lower their price as much, or at all. Indeed, as FOMO sets in the seller may even be able to raise their asking price. As this simulation repeats and changes the latest sale price, the bitcoin ticker updates the information- a feedback loop is when the outcome of the previous iteration affects the next iteration feeding back information on itself so it converges on a similar state- in this case a common / similar price on both exchanges. \n",

Equities have been dumping since January and Bitcoin has held relatively steady. Once it's clear we are in the middle of the recession the smart money will try to front-run the recovery and pile back in to Bitcoin and other equities and it will take off from there.

The fed is in a tough spot though, because if the recession is particularly rough they will want to bring rates back down to juice the economy. However that will increase inflation which is what they are trying to combat by raising them. It's unlikely that rates will go up enough that bonds earn more than inflation any time soon though.

If it can continue to exist, game theory would say it wins. Period. Crap, I sound like Michael Saylor.

One thing they're not cognizant of however, is the level of education in the bitcoin space. Ignorance is something they're counting on, and I'm sure they're surprised already by the resistance and refutation of their FUD.\n",

      "3154 :  Cypher Deos: Bitcoin renaissance art by Lucho Poletti\n",
      "\n",
      "Inspired by Hieronymus Bosch’s Last Judgment & Garden of Earthly Delights, Cypher Deos uses a 3-piece triptych framework to deliver a compelling visual story about the issues inherent to the debt-based fiat money system; presenting Bitcoin as the solution. Cypher Deos emulates the extreme level of detail, symbolic references, and innumerable character illustrations from the original renaissance works and brings them into the digital age with animation & sound for an immersive audiovisual experience.\n",
      "\n",
      "The title, 'Cypher Deos' continues Lucho Poletti's tradition of Latin-based naming conventions for animated bitcoin art collections. It is intended as a play on words for the term 'cypherpunk' (a person who uses encryption when accessing a computer network in order to ensure privacy, especially from government authorities), elevating their status from mere digital punks to gods; thus, Cypher Deos.\n",
      "\n",
      "Inferno (Left inner panel):The Cypher Deos story begins in a fiat inferno where a legion of devilish bankers and debt dealers thrive, sucking economic energy away from their subjects for their own gain. \"Control the Money, Control the People\" is the mode of operation; \"In Debt We Trust\" is the motto. The multitudes of debt slaves cast into inferno all arrived there for different reasons; all the same to be crushed under the burden of debt and burnt by the flames of inflationary monetary policy.\n",
      "\n",
      "Purgatorio (Center inner panel):Once we've escaped the fiat inferno, Cypher Deos moves into a symbolic purgatory on earth. Its inhabitants must atone for the sins of central banks as a battle wages on in the sky above for a better money system. Purgatorio uses symbology from end-times bible prophecy, predicting the end of the age of fiat money.\n",
      "\n",
      "Paradisus (Right inner panel):After atoning for the sins of the fiat system and triumphing over the bankers, our heroes ascend to the network in the sky where we see a glimpse of a cypherpunk paradise. Anonymous whistle blowers, martyrs for free speech, and not-so-shadowy cyber coders assemble around a grand representation of the bitcoin money system; surrounded by ranks of satoshi-based angelic figures: seraphim, cherubim, thrones, and dominions. A network of meditating node runners arise above the lake of fire, escaping the flames of the fiat money system as the bitcoin network lights up with energy from the ever-increasing hash power validating each block in the proof of work consensus.\n",
      "\n",
      "Outer Panels:\n",
      "\n",
      "Mundus Vetus (Outer left panel) shows a burning left hemisphere of earth under a fiat money system and Mundus Novus (Outer right panel) shows a vibrant and energized right hemisphere denominated in bitcoin. Satoshi the creator lurks above.\n",
      "\n",
      "The outer panels open to reveal a unique cut of the battle in the sky from Purgatorio. A host of satoshi-based angelic figures, from the whistleblowers of justice to ascended cypherpunk martyrs and an androgynous 8-armed satoshi god rise up against the highest ranking devilish bankers in a battle for a better money system.\n",
