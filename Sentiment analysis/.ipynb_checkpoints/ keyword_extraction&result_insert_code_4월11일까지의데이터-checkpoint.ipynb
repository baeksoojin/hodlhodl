Creating these strong economic and tax incentives for businesses to migrate to your country is the FASTEST way for El Salvador to become first world. If you look at all of the countries that have transitioned from 3rd world to 1st world over the last 20 years (South Korea, Singapore, Israel, UAE, and Qatar), they all have one thing in common: they became hyper-capitalist. Nayib Bukele realizes this and is trying to copy their playbook. If done correctly, I think El Salvador could have a GDP per capita competitive with Europe in the next 20 years.\\n\\nHowever, Nayib Bukele's presentation was almost too good to be true. It's easy for politicians to make promises on a stage, but it's a lot harder to deliver those promises. The logistics of building this city is far more challenging for El Salvador than Bukele's presentation made it out to be. El Salvador is also a poor third world country full of corruption, so even if the city gets built, there may be some undesirable qualities of the city that we might now like.

And if you think this is bad, wait until an actual bear market, with 40-60% drops at least.\\n\\nFact is we\\'re moving slower than previous cycles, which is to be expected, and judging for the weekly volume, it almost feels like this is a continuation of the summer accumulation with rising support, which is good.  No one said this would be easy.  Every dip is going to test you, so keep holding.  You don\\'t have to buy just because people are screaming \"hold the line!!1!\" We all wanted to hold the line, but buyers got exhausted repeatedly all week.  You do you, and don\\'t let dips like this discourage you.  Just glance at the weekly chart, see how many dips occured every bull market, and how drastic they were.\\n\\nWe\\'ll be fine, hell, we might just be gold within a year (get the reference, plan B fans?).  The market is still in good shape, we\\'re accumulating on an upward trend for crying out loud! And we haven\\'t even picked up any decent momentum yet!  When it kicks off, it\\'ll be worth it, just don\\'t shoot yourself in the foot and sell me your cheap bitcoin, although I won\\'t say no lol\\n\\nBest of luck!'}, {'crawling_date': datetime.date(2021, 12, 3), 'comment': '[deleted]'}, {'crawling_date': datetime.date(2021, 12, 3), 'comment': 'Excellent!!

Like could some spiteful prick(s) just keep mining to increase the supply (in theory)?Or is there something I\\'m missing and for sure the supply will only ever be 21 million? \\n\\nSorry if dumb question, this stuff is hard to study on your own I find, you gotta ask questions.\\n\\nEdit: Too many to thank individually but thanks for the answers guys!

So it could be the case that if Bitcoin were to increase in value dramatically that the counterparties betting against it will not be able to afford to return your Bitcoin to you.  Exchanges too that allow leverage like Binance face a serious problem if Bitcoin increases in price too much.

Plus a lot of them are already in capital markets and like Micheal Saylor can borrow at 0 percent interest.  So you have every insurance company etc. in the world begging for yield you think that if Saylor comes to market and wants to borrow say10 billion at 2 percent they won't eat those bonds up?  You're damn right they will.  So what happens if the price of BTC goes from say 50k to like 200k in a week?  Those exchanges are going to have to cover that loss because those short-sellers are already at 10-1,30-1, some even 100-1.  Those exchanges will go bankrupt.  What all of these guys are used to manipulating is something that more supply can easily be added.  Like stocks, gold, etc.\\n\\nMy point is that places like BitMex should only allow short selling at 1-1 leverage or not at all.

Accordingly, for the \\r\\ntaxation of virtual digital assets, I propose to provide that any income from \\r\\ntransfer of any virtual digital asset shall be taxed at the rate of 30 per cent.\\r\\n\\uf0b7 No deduction in respect of any expenditure or allowance shall be \\r\\nallowed while computing such income except cost of acquisition. \\r\\nFurther, loss from transfer of virtual digital asset cannot be set \\r\\noff against any other income.\"\\n\\n\\nI worked at a law firm for a while, so distilling the above simply tells me:\\n\\nThis law encourages people to NOT buy shitcoins (losses can\\'t be offset), NOT wash trade (again losses can\\'t be offset). AND to HODL (30% Tax on fiat gains).\\n \\n\\nBullish'}, {'crawling_date': datetime.date(2022, 2, 5), 'comment': 'Beautiful to watch after a hard days work.'}, {'crawling_date': datetime.date(2022, 2, 5), 'comment': 'Hodor'}, {'crawling_date': datetime.date(2022, 2, 5), 'comment': 'So lets say the Fed raises rates and inflation is back at 1-2% per year.

I brought up hugely complicated blockbusters as an example of art that takes significant investment and time (although, granted, no one considers the Avengers to be high art).\\n\\nI think an even better example is *Hamilton*. By virtually any measure - complexity of music and lyrics, quality of writing, choreography, scope, thematically - *Hamilton* compares favorably to any classic opera or other performance art. Moreover, not only is it another example of art that took significant time and investment to produce, it's an example of art that I would argue could only be produced with easy money. Would the Medicis have ever given a short Puerto Rican dude with social anxiety the light of day? Answer is no, no way. It's only because he had relatively easy access to capital that we got *Hamilton*, so I consider that a win for the easy money camp, and Ammous doesn't address this fairly straightforward and obvious counterpoint at all.\\n\\nI think this last point is incredibly important and goes under the radar.  One of the significant drawbacks of a Bitcoin standard is that the cost of capital will be very high because (1) there would be a lot less capital to lend, (2) fewer people will be willing and able to lend, and (3) lenders will demand a high yield to lend an appreciating asset.  Moreover, the few who hold the bulk of the coins will get to decide (to borrow a line from Hamilton) who gets funding, who doesn't, and who tells their story.

Since the network does not accept and distribute the generated block instantaneously, but rather presents a delay, it may happen that another miner solves exactly the same block. Thus two blocks are generated in a very close time, and both are distributed to the network for validation. There will be miners distributing one of the blocks and they will start solving the next block based on the hash of the received block. For their part, there will be other miners who received the other block generated first and will also begin solving the next block.  \\n>  \\n>However, there will come a point where a miner finds the solution to the next block based on one of those generated simultaneously. And that's when the miners will take the longest chain. That is, the block from which the next block was generated will show a greater Proof of Work (PoW) and therefore, it will be accepted within the blockchain. While the block with the least amount of PoW, it will be discarded, and therefore, it will not be added to the blockchain.

Established technologies always have the advantage of \"inertia\" because they have been around for a long time and have a lot of people and companies invested in them. This can make the established technology appear stronger than it objectively is. The test can be applied to not only technologies but to pretty much any type of innovation.\\n\\nSo the general idea of the test is to do the following thought experiment: imagine a world where the timeline is reversed, that is, where the new technology appeared first and the established one appeared after. Does the \"new\" technology in this thought experiment stand a chance?\\n\\nLet\\'s apply the test to Bitcoin. Imagine a world where USD is Bitcoin and Bitcoin is USD (in terms of adoption and historical timeline). So Bitcoin has been widely used and accepted for decades but there is this new kid on the block called the US Dollar. This USD thing has a strong base of early adopters who can\\'t stop praising it:\\n\\n- It\\'s centralized which means the government can decide to print as much as it wants. Sure this will make your USD worth less every year a small price to pay for the \"overall good of the economy\".\\n\\n- Self-custody is very inconvenient and risky so you will have to pay a bank to do custody for you. This is actually a good thing because it will make it easier for the government to track your money and confiscate it. That sounds bad but it\\'s a small price to pay to help stop criminals or tax evaders.\\n\\n- Every country will develop their own version of the USD so that they can do all the above. This will make it inconvenient to spend your USD in other countries but this is a small price to pay given all the benefits listed above.\\n\\n- It\\'s not Internet native so you can\\'t directly send or receive it electronically. But third party companies are starting to offer this service. There is this new company called PayPal for example which allows this. There is a risk of getting your account and funds frozen but if you follow their ToS you should be fine.\\n\\nSo, in that thought experiment, will this new USD thing get people excited?

Add 0.04 to 0.0244 and you get 0.0644 Bitcoin. At $10 million that works out to $644k fee per block. That fee is around $133 per transaction - roughly.
